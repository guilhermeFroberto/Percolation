# Percolation


Percolation is a physical phenomenon that describes the transport of fluids through porous media. We present a new approach for extracting local and global percolation features from RGB images. The proposed method is based on multiscale and multidimensional approaches for extracting other fractal measures from histology images. Our method is able to obtain three percolation properties: number of clusters, occurrence of percolation, and size of the largest cluster. This approach aimed to provide an alternative to fractal dimension and lacunarity as ways of evaluation fractal properties in an image.
