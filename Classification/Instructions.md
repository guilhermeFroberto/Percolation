Classification instructions

The code in this directory was used for the classification of percolation features extracted from image datasets.

The wekaClassification.m function was made available in [1] by S. Lee. It creates an interface betweern MATLAB and the machine learning environment Weka [2]. The function receives as input the set of features for the training and validation data, as well as the desired classifier. It outputs the cell vector representing the values of the predicted class of the validation dataset and a numeric vector that represents the class probability of the predictions.

The resulting vectors are given as input to the second function, confusionmatStats.m, which was made available in [3] by A. Cheong. This functions generates a confusion matrix from the input data, along with evaluation values such as accuracy and F-score.
